# Python Solutions for Programming Assignments
All solutions (including optional ungraded exercises) for Coursera Machine Learning by Andrew Ng. Although being of the best introductory courses to build a strong foundation in the field, due to the age of the course itself, some of the techniques are not that accessible. All this is resolved by @diberge with a Python template. Please respect honor code and the regularizations of coursera, treat this only as a reference.
Jupyter notebook on github are known to be buggy, just download and render locally or comeback at another time.
