# Python Solutions for Programming Assignments
All solutions (including optional ungraded exercises) for Coursera Machine Learning by Andrew Ng. Although being of the best introductory courses to build a strong foundation in the field, due to the age of the course itself, some of the techniques are not that accessible. All this is resolved by @diberge with a Python template.\n Please respect honor code and the regularizations of coursera, treat this only as a reference.

## Acknowledgements
Deepest gratitude for professor Andrew Ng, the crew at Stanford and Coursera as well as @dibgerge[https://github.com/dibgerge] for this Python template of the exercises.
